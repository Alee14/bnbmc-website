This passport is readable by command blocks, allowing for swift border processing at countries where it is supported.\n\nAn ePassport+ can be identified by searching for the [-o-] symbol on the front page, and by issuing the command /passport query while holding it.\n\nCountries can now onboard onto ePassport+ by contacting Victor. Existing passports will continue to work at the discretion of the border control officials at the gate."
